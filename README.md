# Historical-Weather-Forecast-Scraper
The goal of this project is to scrape a variety of weather forecast resources (NOAA, Wunderground, Weather.com, etc), and build up histories of their weather forecasts for a number of major cities (NYC, Chicago, etc). Once enough data is collected I can release the dataset along with some fairly interesting analysis on the relative accuracies of different weather services at certain time-outlooks (5 hours out, 1 day out, 3 days out, etc).
